      <h3>c. Public Participation</h3>
      <p>When you join or speak in an OSD.WTF Space on X:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your voice and username may be publicly visible and audible to all listeners.</li>
        <li>X may retain temporary audio copies for up to 30‚Äì120 days for moderation.</li>
        <li>OSD.WTF may review or request access to these recordings to identify significant moments (see Section 6).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not collect private keys, financial data, or personal identifiers beyond what you voluntarily share.</p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the limited data we collect to:</p>

      <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>Our website uses minimal cookies or analytics scripts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may use basic session cookies to keep forms working properly.</li>
        <li>We do not use invasive tracking or behavioral advertising cookies.</li>

      <p>You can disable cookies in your browser at any time; the site will still function.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact and sponsor form submissions are retained only as long as needed to complete correspondence.</li>
        <li>Analytics data is anonymized and used for aggregated reporting.</li>

        <li>OSD.WTF does not permanently store user audio or metadata unless a clip is created with consent.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>c. Third-Party Recording</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Because Spaces are public, listeners or anonymous third parties may record live sessions without our knowledge.</li>
