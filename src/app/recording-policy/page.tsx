      <h1>Recording & Clip Policy ‚Äî OSD.WTF</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 12, 2025<br />
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 12, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This policy explains how OSD.WTF handles the recording, archiving, and use of audio content from live Spaces and other broadcasts.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to respect community consent while preserving cultural moments worth sharing.</p>
      <p>We operate transparently ‚Äî if something is being recorded, you&apos;ll know.</p>

      <h2>2. Recording Status</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>OSD.WTF hosts may choose to enable or disable public recording on X (Twitter) Spaces.</li>
        <li>When recording is active, X displays a &quot;REC&quot; icon visible to all participants.</li>
        <li>Many Spaces are unrecorded by default, meaning no public replay is available after the broadcast ends.</li>
        <li>Even if a Space is not actively recorded, X may temporarily store audio for up to 30 days (or up to 120 days if under moderation review). This is X&apos;s policy, not ours.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Archive Access & Retrieval</h2>
      <p>During this retention window, OSD.WTF may review or retrieve content from X&apos;s archive within the 30‚Äì120 day retention window to create educational or promotional clips.</p>
      <p>Any retrieved material will not be published without obtaining verbal or written consent from the identifiable speakers featured in the segment.</p>
      <p>This process allows OSD.WTF to preserve key moments from long-running or 24-hour Spaces while maintaining respect for participant privacy.</p>

      <h2>4. Clip Creation & Usage</h2>
      <p>OSD.WTF may create short audio or video excerpts (&quot;Clips&quot;) from archived Spaces for cultural, educational, or promotional use.</p>
      <p>When doing so:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants whose voice, likeness, or identifiable comments appear in a clip will be contacted for consent before public release.</li>
        <li>For pre-scheduled shows (like &quot;Who TF is ___?&quot;), participants may grant consent in advance.</li>
        <li>If we cannot reach a participant, and they later request removal, the clip may be taken down at our discretion.</li>
        <li>Clips may appear on official OSD.WTF channels (website, X, YouTube, Spotify, etc.), but will never be sold or licensed commercially without direct agreement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Recordings</h2>
      <p>OSD.WTF is a public, community-driven broadcast project. We host live audio Spaces on X (formerly Twitter) that are open to anyone. Because these sessions are public, participants should understand how recordings, clips, and content may be used or archived.</p>
      <p>Such recordings are outside our control and may occur without our knowledge or consent.</p>
      <p>By joining a Space, participants acknowledge this risk.</p>
      <p>OSD.WTF is not responsible for third-party recordings, reposts, or derivative uses created outside our official channels.</p>

      <h2>6. Transparency & Notice</h2>
      <p>At the start of every Space, hosts will announce whether the session is being recorded or may later be clipped.</p>
      <p>Guests on planned or featured shows will be briefed on this policy in advance.</p>
      
      <div className="disclaimer-box">

      <h2>7. Takedown & Removal Requests</h2>
      <p>If you appear in a clip or recording and wish for it to be removed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you believe your content has been used improperly, contact us at <a href="mailto:clips@osd.wtf">clips@osd.wtf</a> with the clip URL and your X handle. We&apos;ll review and respond within 10 business days.</li>
        <li>Include a link or clear description of the content.</li>
        <li>We will review and respond promptly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will honor reasonable takedown requests and remove or edit the material wherever possible.</p>

      <h2>8. Ownership & Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Speakers retain ownership of their words and likeness.</li>
        <li>By granting consent for a clip, speakers provide OSD.WTF a non-exclusive, worldwide license to reproduce, edit, and distribute that segment for educational or cultural purposes.</li>
        <li>All OSD.WTF Spaces are public. Anyone with an X account can join, listen, and speak if granted &quot;speaker&quot; access by a host.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Views & Liability Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>All Spaces are public, unscripted discussions.</p>
      <p>Opinions expressed belong solely to the individual speakers.</p>
      <p>They do not represent the views of OSD.WTF, OSD (Ordinals Support Desk), its hosts, or partners.</p>
      <p>OSD.WTF assumes no liability for statements made by third parties, nor for actions taken based on information shared in live or recorded broadcasts.</p>

      <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>We may revise this policy to reflect changes in technology, platform rules, or community standards.</p>
      <p>All updates will appear here with a new &quot;Last Updated&quot; date.</p>
      <p>Continued participation after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
